# Flush and Reload Cache Side Channel Attack

This repository is an implementation of a flush-reload side channel attack. 

This attack should be performed on a virtual machine dedicated for the execution of this program. So the safety of your
host machine will not be affected in any way.

It attacks OpenSSL's AES-128's t-table implementation. In order to perform this attack on your own machine,
follow the steps outlined below.

## OpenSSL Installation

Trusted Versions of OpenSSL can be found at: https://www.openssl.org/source/old/. This attack will work for most
versions, but the specific version I used was version openssl-1.1.0f. After downloading the OpenSSL source, go to
the Downloads folder and unzip with:

    tar -xvf openssl-1.1.0f.tar.gz

Now we need to configure OpenSSL to use its t-table c implementation as opposed to the assembly implementation default.
OpenSSL also needs to be configured with debug symbols and specified to use a shared object as opposed to an .a library.
For the appropriate configuration, run:

    cd ~/Downloads/openssl-1.1.0f
    ./config -d shared no-asm no-hw
    
For the selected version: 1.1.0f, this configuration will install OpenSSL in the /usr/local/ directory. The configuration parameters specify
that we allow for debug symbols (used to locate T-table locations), create a shared object, only use c implementations of aes
(to use the t-tables), and to not use any hardware routines. To proceed with the install, run:

    sudo make
    sudo make install_sw

## Finding Cache Hit/Miss Threshold

This repo contains a calibration tool to automatically find the threshold for a cache miss / cache hit
curteousy of https://github.com/IAIK/flush_flush. Simply compile and run the tool with:

    g++ calibration.c -o calibration

This should output an appropriate benchmark for each individual machine. Edit the **newspy.cpp** file's **MIN_CACHE_MISS_CYCLES**
constant to the number that was output.

## Finding T-table Addresses

A flush-reload attack monitors cache lines. To monitor the correct cache lines, we must find the offset of addresses of the t-tables
with respect to the **libcrypto.so** shared object. To find this, perform the following commands:

    cd /usr/lib
    readelf -a libcrypto.so > ~/aeslib.txt
    
This will deconstruct the **libcrypto.so** file and allow us to find the appropriate address offsets. We will use vim to find the
output quickly:

    vi ~/aeslib.txt

Search for the t-tables by pressing '/' and typing 'Te0'. Take note of these offsets, and change the **probe** character array
in **newspy.cpp** to the appropriate offsets for your specific machine.

## Compile and run the program

Since we have installed OpenSSL in a local directory instead of a system directory, we need to tell the linker to use the
appropriate version of OpenSSL. To do this, type in terminal:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

The command for compiling the newspy.c file is:

    g++ newspy.cpp -o newspy -I/usr/local/include/ssl -L/usr/local/lib -lcrypto
    
The output should be equal to the key specified in the newspy.c file.
